# 20Roller
Python based app which converts most of the stats for DnD 4E NPCs, to Radiance D20

Conversion is done based on the suggestions from Dario Nardi, the creator of Radiance, as well as on my playtests. Thank you again, Dario!

The app outputs a JSON file that can be imported to Roll20 by using the Roll20 Enhancement Suite browser addon

Run the app by running 20Roller.py, fill out all the fields and click GO! The JSON file will be created in the same folder.
